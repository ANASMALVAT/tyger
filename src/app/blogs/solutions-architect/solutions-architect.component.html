            <h1>What is AWS Solutions Architect Associate Certification?</h1>
            <p>
                With the rise of Cloud Computing, companies have constantly been shifting from running their infrastructure on-premise, to running them on cloud, which offers far more elasticity in terms of scaling and resiliency in case a disaster strikes.
            </p>

            <p>
                The AWS Solutions Architect - Associate certification validates your ability to design and deploy well-architected solutions on AWS, which is the leading cloud provider today. In simple terms, this exam tests your ability to propose an architecture given a specific scenario. For example: a company wants their application to continue running even if an entire AWS region, where that application was hosted, is down due to a disaster. So, how would you design their infrastructure around this use case?

            <h1>My Preparation Strategy</h1>
            <p>
                Over a span of two months, I strategically allocated my study time alongside my co-op and coding society responsibilities. On weekdays, I dedicated 1-2 hours, while on weekends, I set aside 4 hours for intensive exam preparation.        
            </p>
            <p>
                For a comprehensive understanding of the AWS Solutions Architect - Associate concepts, I enrolled in Stephane Maarek's highly acclaimed course available on Udemy. This course provided me with valuable insights and served as a foundation for my preparation. To further enhance my knowledge, I purchased two practice test packages by Stephane Maarek and Jon Bonso, each containing six practice tests. Additionally, I utilized a free practice test provided with the course.        
            </p>
            <p>
                Throughout the practice tests, I made it a point to document questions that I answered incorrectly or found challenging, along with their corresponding explanations. This approach enabled me to create a personalized study resource for thorough revision before the exam. To organize my knowledge in a structured manner, I diligently compiled all the information from the course and practice tests into concise notes. For this purpose, I opted for the classic method of note-taking using a physical notebook.
            </p>
            <p>
                Remember, with determination and a structured approach, you can achieve your certification goals. Best of luck on your AWS Solutions Architect - Associate journey!

        <div class="taking-test"> 
            <h1>Taking the Test</h1>
            <p>
                You have two options for taking the AWS Solutions Architect - Associate certification exam: offline at a testing center or online from the comfort of your home. If testing centers are available in your area, I recommend choosing the offline option. However, if there are no nearby testing centers, you can opt for the online exam.
            </p>
            <p>
                Keep in mind that the online test has strict proctoring measures in place. If the proctor cancels your exam due to any violations, a refund will not be provided. In such cases, you will need to reschedule and retake the exam at a later date.

            <p>
                To excel in the AWS Solutions Architect - Associate certification exam, I recommend taking multiple practice tests. These tests will familiarize you with common exam topics and closely mirror the actual exam questions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Given the vast amount of information to cover, it's crucial to filter out irrelevant details and create concise notes. This will enable you to efficiently revise key concepts within a short period, typically 1 or 2 days, before the exam.By leveraging practice tests and concise notes, you'll optimize your exam preparation and increase your chances of success.
