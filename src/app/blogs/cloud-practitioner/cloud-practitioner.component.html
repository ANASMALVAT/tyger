            <h1>My Preparation Strategy</h1>
            <p>
                Over the course of two weeks, 6 hours a day, I diligently managed my study time while balancing my commitments to work and other responsibilities. To optimize my preparation for the AWS Cloud Practitioner certification, I followed a structured approach.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the first week, I dedicated my focus to completing an extensive course by Stephen Marek available on Udemy. This highly regarded course provided me with a comprehensive understanding of the key concepts and fundamentals required for the certification.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the second week, I engaged in rigorous practice tests to solidify my knowledge and enhance my exam readiness. I specifically relied on the practice tests designed by Stephen Marek, leveraging his expertise to simulate the exam environment effectively.
            </p>
            <p>
                To organize my knowledge in a structured manner, I diligently compiled all the information from the course and practice tests into concise notes. For this purpose, I opted for the classic method of note-taking using a physical notebook.
            </p>

        <div class="taking-test"> 
            <h1>Taking the Test</h1>
            <p>
                You have two options for taking the AWS Cloud Practitioner certification exam: offline at a testing center or online from the convenience of your home. If there are testing centers available in your vicinity, I recommend selecting the offline option. However, if there are no nearby testing centers or you prefer the flexibility of an online exam, you can choose the online option.
            </p>
            <p>
                Keep in mind that the online test has strict proctoring measures in place. If the proctor cancels your exam due to any violations, a refund will not be provided. In such cases, you will need to reschedule and retake the exam at a later date.
